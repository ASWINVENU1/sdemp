#  A Word of Caution!

Be particularly wary about plugging any of these circuits described in these projectss into your expensive computers, audio, musical or electronic equipment - do so at your own risk! And make sure you double check everything first.

An old, second-hand or hand-me-down music keyboard or computer is well worth the investment for experimenting.
